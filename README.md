**Explorer of Indonesian Population Pyramids from Harmonized and Non-harmonized Census Data**

---

## Overview

`censuspyrID` R package provides harmonized and unharmonized population pyramid datasets
from the Indonesian population censuses (1971â€“2020).
It includes functions for loading, filtering, and visualizing population data,
as well as an **interactive Shiny application** for exploring demographic structures
across provinces and census years.

The harmonized dataset (`hpop5`) uses consistent province codes across censuses
to enable long-term trend analysis despite administrative expansion
(*pemekaran*), while the unharmonized dataset (`ypop5`) retains original province
codes as published in each census year.

Data sources include:

- **IPUMS International (1971â€“2010)** â€” [IPUMS International](https://doi.org/10.18128/D020.V7.6)
- **Population Census 2020 (BPS Indonesia)** â€” [BPS Census Portal](http://sensus.bps.go.id/topik/tabular/sp2020/3)

Both datasets were processed with steps including aggregation into 5-year age groups,
pro-rata redistribution for missing attributes, and demographic smoothing
(Arriaga and Karupâ€“Kingâ€“Newton methods).

## Installation & Run

You can install the development version of `censuspyrID` from GitHub using [`remotes`](https://cran.r-project.org/package=remotes):

```r
# install remotes if not already installed
install.packages("remotes")

# install censuspyrID from GitHub
remotes::install_github("aripurwantosp/censuspyrID")
```
The core feature of this package is the `censuspyrID_explorer()`, an interactive Shiny application that allows you to visually explore population pyramids, age profiles, and demographic trends across different provinces, census years, and smoothing methods., from R do
```r
# load package
library(censuspyrID)

# launch the interactive application
censuspyrID_explorer()

```
The `censuspyrID_explorer()` function launches the application in your default web browser. See the Help menu within the application for a detailed navigation guide.

## Functions

Besides the interactive Shiny application, **censuspyrID** also provides several 
functions that you can use directly in your R scripts for data processing and visualization:

| Function             | Description |
|----------------------|-------------|
| `load_pop_data()`    | Loads the main population datasets (`hpop5` or `ypop5`) with optional demographic smoothing applied (Arriaga or Karupâ€“Kingâ€“Newton). |
| `pop_data_by_year()` | Filters the data for a specific census year. |
| `pop_data_by_reg()`  | Filters the data for a specific province ID. |
| `pyr_single()`       | Creates a single population pyramid plot for a given region and year. |
| `pyr_trends()`       | Generates trend plots of population pyramids over multiple census years. |
| `area_trends()`      | Plots population proportions across three broad age groups (young, working-age, old) over time. |
| `pop_summary()`      | Prints a formatted statistical summary, including sex ratio and dependency ratios. |

### Example Usage

```r
library(censuspyrID)

# Load harmonized population data with Arriaga smoothing
pop_data <- load_pop_data(harmonized = TRUE, smoothing = "arriaga")

# Filter data for the 2020 census
pop_2020 <- pop_data_by_year(pop_data, year = 2020)

# Filter data for a specific province (e.g., DKI Jakarta, province_id = 31)
pop_jakarta <- pop_data_by_reg(pop_2020, reg = 31)

# Create a single population pyramid for Jakarta in 2020
pyr_single(pop_jakarta, reg_code = 31, year = 2020)

# Generate pyramid trends for Jakarta across all census years
pyr_trends(pop_data, reg_code = 31)

# Plot age-structure trends (0-14, 15-64, 65+) for Jakarta
area_trends(pop_data, reg_code = 31)

# Print a summary with sex ratio and dependency ratios
pop_summary(pop_jakarta)
```
