## About the App

**censuspyrID Explorer** is an application for exploring harmonized and non-harmonized population pyramids from Indonesiaâ€™s population censuses (1971â€“2020).
Analyzing population structures over time requires consistent data. Subnational analysis in Indonesia faces additional challenges due to administrative splits of provinces.

This application (part of the `censuspyrID` package) documents population structure data from the Indonesian Population Censuses (1971â€“2020), harmonizes them to ensure consistency, and provides dynamic exploration features through interactive visualizations and tables.

The app supports the analysis of demographic dynamics in Indonesia at both the national and provincial levels, serving purposes in education, research, and policymaking.
